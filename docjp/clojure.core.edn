This facilitates easy reuse of existing fns and fn maps, for\n  code reuse/mixins without derivation or composition. You can extend\n  an interface to a protocol. This is primarily to facilitate interop\n  with the host (e.g. Java) but opens the door to incidental multiple\n  inheritance of implementation since a class can inherit from more\n  than one interface, both of which extend the protocol. It is TBD how\n  to specify which impl to use. You can extend a protocol on nil.\n\n  If you are supplying the definitions explicitly (i.e. not reusing\n  exsting functions or mixin maps), you may find it more convenient to\n  use the extend-type or extend-protocol macros.\n\n  Note that multiple independent extend clauses can exist for the same\n  type, not all protocols need be defined in a single extend call.\n\n  See also:\n  extends?, satisfies?, extenders",

Note also that recur calls to the method\n  head should *not* pass the target object, it will be supplied\n  automatically and can not be substituted.\n\n  The return type can be indicated by a type hint on the method name,\n  and arg types can be indicated by a type hint on arg names. If you\n  leave out all hints, reify will try to match on same name/arity\n  method in the protocol(s)/interface(s) - this is preferred. If you\n  supply any hints at all, no inference is done, so all hints (or\n  default of Object) must be correct, for both arguments and return\n  type. If a method is overloaded in a protocol/interface, multiple\n  independent method definitions must be supplied.  If overloaded with\n  same arity in an interface you must specify complete hints to\n  disambiguate - a missing hint implies Object.\n\n  recur works to method heads The method bodies of reify are lexical\n  closures, and can refer to the surrounding local scope:\n  \n  (str (let [f \"foo\"] \n       (reify Object \n         (toString [this] f))))\n  == \"foo\"\n\n  (seq (let [f \"foo\"] \n       (reify clojure.lang.Seqable \n         (seq [this] (seq f)))))\n  == (\\f \\o \\o))\n  \n  reify always implements clojure.lang.IObj and transfers meta\n  data of the form to the created object.\n  \n  (meta ^{:k :v} (reify Object (toString [this] \"foo\")))\n  == {:k :v}",

Use :require in the ns macro\n  in preference to calling this directly.\n\n  Libs\n\n  A 'lib' is a named set of resources in classpath whose contents define a\n  library of Clojure code. Lib names are symbols and each lib is associated\n  with a Clojure namespace and a Java package that share its name. A lib's\n  name also locates its root directory within classpath using Java's\n  package name to classpath-relative path mapping. All resources in a lib\n  should be contained in the directory structure under its root directory.\n  All definitions a lib makes should be in its associated namespace.\n\n  'require loads a lib by loading its root resource. The root resource path\n  is derived from the lib name in the following manner:\n  Consider a lib named by the symbol 'x.y.z; it has the root directory\n  <classpath>/x/y/, and its root resource is <classpath>/x/y/z.clj. The root\n  resource should contain code to create the lib's namespace (usually by using\n  the ns macro) and load any additional lib resources.\n\n  Libspecs\n\n  A libspec is a lib name or a vector containing a lib name followed by\n  options expressed as sequential keywords and arguments.\n\n  Recognized options:\n  :as takes a symbol as its argument and makes that symbol an alias to the\n    lib's namespace in the current namespace.\n  :refer takes a list of symbols to refer from the namespace or the :all\n    keyword to bring in all public vars.\n\n  Prefix Lists\n\n  It's common for Clojure code to depend on several libs whose names have\n  the same prefix. When specifying libs, prefix lists can be used to reduce\n  repetition. A prefix list contains the shared prefix followed by libspecs\n  with the shared prefix removed from the lib names. After removing the\n  prefix, the names that remain must not contain any periods.\n\n  Flags\n\n  A flag is a keyword.\n  Recognized flags: :reload, :reload-all, :verbose\n  :reload forces loading of all the identified libs even if they are\n    already loaded\n  :reload-all implies :reload and also forces loading of all libs that the\n    identified libs directly or indirectly load via require or use\n  :verbose triggers printing information about each load, alias, and refer\n\n  Example:\n\n  The following would load the libraries clojure.zip and clojure.set\n  abbreviated as 's'.\n\n  (require '(clojure zip [set :as s]))",
